# 📘 Object-Oriented Programming in PHP

This repository contains materials and exercises for a course on Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in PHP. The course covers several key concepts in OOP, including constructors, inheritance, and visibility.

## 📚 Course Contents

### 🏗️ Constructors

In PHP, a constructor is a special "magic" method that is automatically called when an object is created. It's typically used to initialize the properties of the object. In this course, you'll learn how to define and use constructors in your PHP classes.

### 🎁 Inheritance

Inheritance is a fundamental concept in OOP that allows you to define a new class based on an existing class. This allows you to reuse code and create more specialized classes based on general ones. This course will teach you how to use inheritance in PHP to create more efficient and organized code.

### 👁️ Visibility

Visibility in PHP OOP refers to the accessibility of properties and methods in a class. There are three levels of visibility:

- Public: The property or method can be accessed from anywhere, both inside and outside of the class.
- Protected: The property or method can only be accessed from within the class itself or any classes that extend it.
- Private: The property or method can only be accessed from within the class itself.

In this course, you'll learn how to use these different levels of visibility to control access to your code.

## 📝 Study Tips

- Don't worry too much about configuration details. The focus of this course is on understanding and applying OOP concepts.
- Spend most of your time on the exercises. The best way to learn programming is by doing, so make sure to practice what you learn in the lessons.
