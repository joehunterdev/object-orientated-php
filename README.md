# Object Orientated Programming in PHP

### Constructors
Use constructors todo whatever a class should do *First* 
- It is a magic method that is called when an object is created

## Inheritance
- Is extending an existing class to create a new class
- There is no limit to the number of classes that can be extended

## Visibility
- Public: Can be accessed from anywhere
- Protected: Can only be accessed from within the class or any class that extends it
- Private: Can only be accessed from within the class 
    - `$this` lives in this scope

## Study tips:
- There shoulnd be any configs but dont get bogged down in the details
- Focus on the excercises
